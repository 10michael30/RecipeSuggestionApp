# RecipeSuggestionApp
Revature Project 2
Team recAPI's: Dylan Corbus, Mike Davis, Joel DeVos, Sammy Eang, Tiffany 
Mac Donald, Jeffrey Zhong

The app we are designing will suggest to the user recipes based on the ingredients they already own. It will start off with recipes they can most easily make followed by recipes they have most of the ingredients to, in decreasing order. i.e. After things they can make, it'll suggest recipes that are perhaps missing 1 ingredient, followed by possible recipes that are missing 2 ingredients.

We will be using angular for our front-end and hibernate for the server 
side, which will connect to an Oracle database normalized to 3NF.
