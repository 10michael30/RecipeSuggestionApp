# RecipeSuggestionApp
Revature Project 2

The app we are designing will suggest to the user recipes based on the ingredients they already own. It will start off with recipes they can most easily make followed by recipes they have most of the ingredients to, in decreasing order. i.e. After things they can make, it'll suggest recipes that are perhaps missing 1 ingredient, followed by possible recipes that are missing 2 ingredients.
